## Detailed Overview

### What is MaiChe?

MaiChe is a high-performance email validation command-line interface (CLI) tool engineered to solve one of the most persistent challenges in digital marketing: maintaining clean, deliverable email lists. Built with Go programming language, MaiChe leverages concurrent processing and intelligent resource management to validate email addresses at scale while maintaining exceptional accuracy.

Unlike simple syntax checkers or basic validation services, MaiChe performs deep verification through actual SMTP conversations with mail servers, confirming not just that an email address is properly formatted, but that the mailbox actually exists and can receive mail—all without sending a single email.

### The Business Case for Email Validation

Every year, approximately 22.5% of email addresses become invalid due to job changes, abandoned accounts, or deactivated domains. For businesses relying on email marketing, this decay translates into:

- **Financial losses** from sending to non-existent addresses
- **Damaged sender reputation** leading to spam folder placement
- **Skewed analytics** making campaign performance difficult to measure
- **Potential blacklisting** from excessive bounce rates

MaiChe addresses these challenges by providing enterprise-grade validation that goes beyond basic checks to ensure your emails reach real, engaged recipients.

### How MaiChe Works

#### 1. **Multi-Stage Validation Pipeline**

MaiChe processes each email through a sophisticated validation pipeline:

**Syntax Validation**

- RFC 5322 compliance checking
- Local part and domain structure validation
- Special character and length verification
- Edge case handling (quoted strings, escaped characters)

**Domain Verification**

- DNS lookup for domain existence
- MX record checking for mail capability
- Intelligent caching to reduce redundant lookups
- Custom DNS server support for restricted environments

**SMTP Verification**

- Establishes connection with target mail server
- Performs EHLO/HELO negotiation
- Executes MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands
- Analyzes server responses to determine mailbox status
- No actual email delivery—completely safe

**Intelligence Layer**

- Role-based email detection (admin@, support@, etc.)
- Disposable email identification
- Catch-all domain detection
- Pattern analysis for suspicious addresses

#### 2. **Performance Architecture**

MaiChe's architecture prioritizes speed without sacrificing accuracy:

- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable worker pools process multiple emails simultaneously
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Per-domain throttling prevents server blocks while maximizing throughput
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses SMTP connections for efficiency
- **Streaming Processing**: Handles files of any size without memory constraints
