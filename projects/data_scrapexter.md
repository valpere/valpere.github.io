### Product Description

**DataScrapexter** is a modular, scalable web scraping solution built on Go 1.21+, designed to handle diverse websites—from static HTML to JavaScript-heavy single-page applications (SPAs)—while evading advanced anti-scraping protections. It combines configuration-driven operation (via YAML/JSON with Viper) with sophisticated anti-detection mechanisms (chromedp, Rod, 2Captcha) and a robust data processing pipeline (GORM, Kafka). The platform supports multi-format outputs (JSON, CSV, Excel, databases) and integrates with cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) for storage and analytics, ensuring compliance with GDPR/CCPA through built-in features like robots.txt respect and audit logging.

### Package Details

#### 1. Basic Package

**Target Audience**: Hobbyists, individual developers, small startups, and data analysts.

**Key Features**:

- **Core Scraping**: HTTP client (net/http) with Goquery for CSS selector-based data extraction.
- **Anti-Detection**: Basic User-Agent rotation (50+ browser signatures), fixed rate limiting (1-5 second delays), and manual HTTP proxy support.
- **Configuration**: YAML-based site definitions managed by Viper.
- **Output**: Exports data to JSON and CSV formats.
- **CLI**: Cobra-based command-line interface for user-friendly operation.
- **Logging**: Structured logging with logrus for debugging and monitoring.

**Use Case Example**: A freelance data analyst needs to extract product listings from 10 static e-commerce sites for market research. They create a YAML configuration to target product titles and prices:

```yaml
name: "ecommerce_site"
base_url: "https://example-shop.com"
fields:
  - name: "title"
    selector: "h2.product-title"
    type: "text"
  - name: "price"
    selector: ".price"
    type: "text"
rate_limit: 2s
```

**CLI Example**:

```bash
# Run the scraper with the configuration file
datascrapexter scrape --config configs/ecommerce_site.yaml --output products.json

# View help for the scrape command
datascrapexter scrape --help

# Output:
# Usage:
#   datascrapexter scrape [flags]
# Flags:
#   -c, --config string   Path to the configuration file (required)
#   -o, --output string   Output file path (JSON or CSV)
