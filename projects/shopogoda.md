![Connected Across Teams](/projects/assets/images/shopogoda/connected_across_teams-2-0384x0256.png)

üí° **From Problem to Production: Building ShoPogoda with AI**

I noticed a pattern: organizations lose thousands to weather-related disruptions because monitoring is manual, alerts come too late, and systems don't integrate with existing workflows.

So I built ShoPogoda ‚Äî automated weather intelligence delivered through channels teams already use. The twist? Built it in days using AI-assisted development, not months of traditional coding.

**The Core Insight:**

People don't need another weather app. They need proactive alerts that arrive when conditions threaten operations, integrate with existing communication tools, and require zero training.

**What We Built:**

A Telegram bot that monitors weather conditions 24/7, sends customized alerts when thresholds are exceeded, and integrates with Slack/Teams for enterprise deployment. Built with Go, deployed on free-tier infrastructure, serving real users in production.

**The Results:**

- 99.5% uptime
- <500ms response times
- $0/month operational costs
- Production-deployed serving multiple organizations
- Built in days, not months

**Why It Matters:**

This isn't just about weather monitoring. It's proof that AI-assisted development enables senior engineers to ship production-grade software at unprecedented speed without sacrificing quality or architecture.

Every organization faces weather risks. Most handle it with manual monitoring. ShoPogoda makes it proactive and automated. AI made building it fast and enjoyable.

**What's Next:**

Open-sourced the entire platform. Adding AI-powered features. Building toward v1.0 release.

The full technical breakdown and deployment guides are on GitHub. Would love to hear your thoughts on AI-assisted development!
