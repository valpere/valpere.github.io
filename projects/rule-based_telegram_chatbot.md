### Problem & Solution Fit

In today’s fast-paced digital environment, customers expect immediate responses and round-the-clock support. Traditional customer service models struggle to meet these demands efficiently, often leading to delayed responses, increased costs, and inconsistent service quality. The Rule-Based Telegram ChatBot project addresses these challenges by automating customer interactions on Telegram, a messaging platform with over 2 billion users globally.

For example, a retail business can utilize the bot to promptly handle product inquiries and order confirmations, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and conversion rates.
